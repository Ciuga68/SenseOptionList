SenseOption
===========

An Option List visualisation for Qlik Sense - allows selection of an option from a horizontal list. 
The selected option value can be used to drive things like: 

- cyclic dimensions
- conditional dimensions or measures, (although these are not available in Sense you can mimic them with nested if() expressions)
- filtering data
 
..and whatever else you can think of.
